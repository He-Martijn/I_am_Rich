// Since this is an open source repo. For everyone who reads this :
// I follow the FLutter course by Angela Yu on github.
// This lesson we create an app called I am rich.
// According to an urban legend such an app was sold for
// way to much money. So people could show off that they where rich.
// All it does was showing an drawing of a diamond.
// Anyway consider this app a sort of ' Hello World' app.
//
// Needles to say : This project is not going to be published in any app store.
