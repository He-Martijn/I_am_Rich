## About this project. 

I follow the FLutter course by Angela Yu on github.
This lesson we create an app called I am rich.
According to an urban legend such an app was sold for
way to much money. So people could show off that they where rich.
All it does was showing an drawing of a diamond.
Anyway consider this app a sort of ' Hello World' app.

Needles to say : This project is not going to be published in any app store.

Regards, Martijn.
